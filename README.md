- If they are over 16, print 'You're too old for school"
- If they are 0, print "You're not born yet!"

### Section B
1. Write a function called is_odd that will return True or False if the integer passed as a parameter is odd (hint: x % 2 will return true for all odd numbers)
2. Write a function that accepts a word and returns it backwards, e.g. 'hello' -> 'olleh'
3. Write a recursive function that accepts a number and prints that number of stars, followed by ever decreasing stars on each line, E.g:

4. Create a padlock function. You need to be able to pass in a passcode and if its correct it should return "Unlock", else "Locked"
5. Write a function that returns the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and limit (parameter). For example, if limit is 20, it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20
6. Write a function called is_prime() that accepts a number and return True or False if the number of prime or not
7. Write a function that checks to see if a string is a pallindrome, if it is, it will return True and False if it is not.
8. Write a function that checks to see if a sentence is a pallindrome, if it is, it will return True and False if it is not. 
- Tip - you may want to format your sentence so it is all lower case, and .replace() to get rid of white spaces.


## Session 6 exercises

### Section A
1. Read the file 'jabberwocky.txt' and print its content to the screen
2. Read the file 'austen.txt' and print the amount of lines in the file
3. Each line of the file 'numbers.txt' contains a number, write a script to add up all the values in the file

### Section B
1. Ask the user to enter their name and append this to a file called 'register.txt'
2. Create a new file called 'even.txt' that contains only the even numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'
3. 'secret.txt' contains a secret message. Each number represents the letter of the alphabet where 1 = A, 2 = B ... Z = 26. Work out what the secret message says
4. Benford’s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data are probably going to be small. For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. Work out which of the files contains fake data.


## Session 7

### Section A

1. Create a function that returns the first and last letters of the word passed in as separate variables.
2. Create a function that takes the circumferance of a circle and return the radius and area.
3. Create a function that takes a file name and word. Search the file to find all lines that start with the given word. Test your function using the file 'austen.txt' and find all lines that begin with "Mr". Hint: is a function that returns True/False if a string ends with a value...maybe there is one that checks to see if a string "starts with"?
4. Create a function that will accept any number of parameters and save them all to a file, each on a new line.
5. Modify your previous answer to save key/value pairs in a file:
fname: Alice
lname: Smith
phone: 555-1234
6. Create a function that can accept a series of numbers and a mathematical operand. Return the result of calculating the expression. E.g.:
calculate(1, 2, 3, 4, operand = "multiply")
calculate(65, 200, 84, 12, operand = "add")`
7. Google the Python CSV library, and modify question 5 to save the data as a csv file. Make it so that you can enter as many contacts as you want and they each end up on a new row within the csv.

## Session 8

### Section A

1. Create a Person class, initialise it with a name. Create a method for the Person class that will say hello to the name.
2. Create a Circle class, initialise it with a radius. Create two methods for the Circle class: get_area() and get_circumference() which give both respective areas and circumference, to 2 decimal placese.
- Note: Area of a circle = πr ** 2
- Circumference = 2πr
- Use the round() function to get the answer to 2 decimal places
3. Create a Employee class and initialise it with name and staff number.
i. Make methods to:

- display_info - It should display all the information of the employee.

- set_department - It should assign the department to employee.

- set_bonus - It should assign a bonus amount to the employee.

ii. Create the instance attributes first name and last name instead of name.

- Create two methods full_name and email_address in the Employee class.

- Given a person's first and last names:

- Form the full_name method by simply joining the first and last name together, separated by a space.

- Form the email_address by joining the first and last name together with a . in between, and follow it with @company.com at the end. Make sure everything is in lowercase.

4. Create a Vehicle parent class, initialise it with, wheels, colour and a method to display all this information.
i. Create a Tesla (or any car) child classs and add a method to get the miles and a method to display all this information.
ii. Change the colour of the vehicle.
iii. Delete the wheels.
5. Create a class called Upper which has two methods called get_word and print_word.
the get_word method should accept a string from the user
the print_word method prints the string in upper case.
6. Create a Sandwich class with the attributes order_number and ingredients.
i. The ingredients attributes is given as a list - (Note: use list() to enable this).
- Only the ingredients attributes will be given as input.
ii. The order attriubte will be a method that counts the order number.
iii. Make three methods for the following favourite sandwiches, for customers who don't want to create a sandwich:
- vegan_hot - vegan cheese, meatless meatballs, jalapenos
- meat_feast - steak, peppers, cheese
- veggie - tomamto, spinach, mushroom, eggs
