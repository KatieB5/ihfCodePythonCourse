### Section B
1. Write a function called is_odd that will return True or False if the integer passed as a parameter is odd (hint: x % 2 will return true for all odd numbers)
2. Write a function that accepts a word and returns it backwards, e.g. 'hello' -> 'olleh'
3. Write a recursive function that accepts a number and prints that number of stars, followed by ever decreasing stars on each line, E.g:

8. Write a function that checks to see if a sentence is a pallindrome, if it is, it will return True and False if it is not. 
- Tip - you may want to format your sentence so it is all lower case, and .replace() to get rid of white spaces.
